Authentication is needed when an application needs to know the identity of the current user.Typically these applications manage data on behalf of that user and need to make sure that this user can onlyaccess the data for which he is allowed. The most common example for that is (classic) web applications –but native and JS-based applications also have a need for authentication.
The most common authentication protocols are SAML2p, WS-Federation and OpenID Connect – SAML2p being themost popular and the most widely deployed.
OpenID Connect is the newest of the three, but is considered to be the future because it has themost potential for modern applications. It was built for mobile application scenarios right from the startand is designed to be API friendly.
